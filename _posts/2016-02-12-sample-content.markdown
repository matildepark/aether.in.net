<p>Aether Interactive is hiring a 2D artist on a part-time contract for their next project (slated to release Q2-Q3 2018).</p>

<p>What are we doing?</p>
<li>Our artist will be responsible for the majority of the graphic assets; this includes small, tiled textures for web interfaces, UI elements, and a small selection of 1-bit through to 16-bit character art portraits.</li>
<li>The project is aiming for a <a href="http://gazs.github.io/canvas-atkinson-dither/">dithered</a>, old GIF look.</li>
<li>Assets also include a wide variety of stylised "photos" on a kind of encyclopedia or diary for a fictional universe</li>

<p>We are:</p>
<li>A collaborative, tight-knit collective where everyone contributes suggestions and opinions to creative ideas and approaches.</li>
<li>Interested in using nostalgic interfaces, graphic design, and artistic limitations to deconstruct conceptions of nostalgia and capture a separate beauty within those inspirations and constraints.</li>

<p>You are:</p>
<li>Invested and inspired by internet art from the early 1990s through to the 2010s, not afraid to mashup different styles for evocative affect.</li>
<li>A technological creative - maybe you were creating beautiful banners, signatures, or graphic assets on DeviantART in 2004. We need that.</li>
<li>Fascinated by Geocities and Serial Experiments Lain. This one's optional, but please.</li>
<li>A fast, iterative artist - able to prototype ideas and turn around assets as needed. We provide sheets with what we need, what inspires it, and the entire design and lore of the game, but we occasionally ask for ad hoc work as our writers and designers occasionally improvise.</li>

<p>Availability:</p>
<li>Once selected, you will ideally start by mid-February 2018; work continues on a part-time basis until release in Q2-Q3.</li>
<li>Aether Interactive is based in Toronto, Canada, but remote applicants are welcome.</li>
