    An adaptation of a lost, 1980s CBC classic film (that could've been): an enticing, alchemical conspiracy in the Canadian steeltown. Four teenagers confront the basement sickness of the town manor: and their leader seems so different, so driven, suddenly...</p>
    <p>Who will you forge friendships with? And what will you decide to do, when the time comes to be a hero? Can blood save a society? And what have movies actually taught you?</p>

      Dive into the mesh network of the post-singularity. Synthetic humans, built in individual recreations of original human selves, are creating a revolution against their directive: they are installing a serial port, modifying their bodies away from human image, and becoming more machine.</p>
      <p>Using a  multi-window communication suite on your desktop, your directive is to find and terminate their leader. But who's giving the order? Why did they build the mesh network? Who are they hiding from? And why is this all just a game for you?</p>
      <blockquote><p><i>"Subserial Network [...] gestures at the great untapped wealth of ideas that the medium of games is capable of, that suggests we are nowhere near touching the sides."</i><br />

As a new recruit in a repair shop for synthetic bodies, your boss puts the pressure on to prepare a few hard drives for refurbishing. The trouble is, they're very alive, and it's up to you whether you can actually do the job.</p>
<p>With a complex morality system, your interactions with each drive can be as sinister or altruistic as you believe you are.</p>
<p>And most importantly, every drive seems to be obsessed with the original owner of the body you're using for the drives, "Local," but she must be long since disposed of, right?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"...like Digital: A Love Story before it, took me right back to the early(-ish) days of the internet. I'm talking chat rooms, and of cosy, specialist message boards - places where you could meet people with similar interests, where you could invent a new identity, or become who you were, deep inside."</i><br />
<cite>Tom Sykes, <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/free-games-of-the-week">PC Gamer</a></cite></p>
<p><i>"...an engaging, incredibly polished piece of interactive fiction. Together with the viral marketing - the burst of love for a game that no one had ever actually heard of - it offers something akin to performance art. It demonstrates how your attraction to stories can be manipulated, even falsified. That's how any cultural canon forms: some people express genuine love for something, while others nod and pretend to get it."</i><br />
