<blockquote>If early Twine games were defined by the works of Porpentine and Anna Anthropy, modern Twine is defined by Aether Interactive.

<p>Aether Interactive was a game development company based in Toronto, Canada, founded by <a href="http://matildepark.ca">Matilde Park</a> and <a href="http://wonderbreath.work">Penelope Evans</a> in May 2017 that operated until December 2018. In that period Aether Interactive released four projects (with a fifth pre-dating the company), including both self-funded works and works with external partners. Its collaborators have since moved onto other projects.</p> 
<p>If you have any inquiries, you can still reach Matilde <a href="mailto:matilde@park.computer">by email</a>.</p>
<p>Aether Interactive was devoted to creating interactive media and video games according to its values of deconstruction, compassion, empathy, and accessibility.</p>
